        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Arizona, raised in the Pacific Northwest, and spent a fairly signficant amount of time living in Hawaii. My family is kind of on the larger side, and I am the youngest of 4 children. I've worked in fast food and retail, but I also spent 6 years in the Navy as a linguist and intelligence analyst.</p>
        <p class="more-content">My hobbies are varied and many, but generally fall within the construct of nerdy and geeky things. I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons, as well as a wide variety of video games in many genres and on several platforms. I enjoy most kinds of music, however I am not a particularly big fan of country music.</p>
        <p id="something-else">I don't know why I chose this color combination, but I thought it might be fun to try to make this last paragraph look like an alert or warning.</p>
